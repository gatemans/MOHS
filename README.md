# Multi-Harmony Search Algorithm (MOHS)

This repository contains the MATLAB implementation of the Multi-Harmony Search (MOHS) algorithm, an advanced metaheuristic optimization method inspired by the process of creating musical harmony.

## Features
- Flexible implementation for single- and multi-objective optimization.
- Easily customizable parameters (e.g., Harmony Memory Size, HMCR, PAR).
- Includes a simple example with the Sphere function.

## File Structure
